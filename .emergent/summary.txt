The AI engineer's trajectory shows a clear transition from refining an existing FavOrg Audit Log System to developing a new, standalone QA-Report-App. Initially, the focus was on enhancing FavOrg's UI/UX, implementing  persistence, and detailed PDF exports. The core recent work involved establishing the QA-Report-App's foundation (FastAPI backend, SQLAlchemy/SQLite, JWT auth, React frontend). Challenges included resolving Tailwind CSS v4 vs v3 configuration, fixing SQLAlchemy  errors, and iterating on password hashing. The project progressed to core functionalities like login, dashboard, project/test suite management, import/export, and generating documentation. The most recent task involved updating test points based on user-requested GUI orientation, fixing frontend compilation errors in , and re-integrating a missing Allgemeines Design category into the FavOrg AuditLog sidebar. Database re-initialization and port conflicts during frontend startup were also resolved.

The overarching goal was to enhance the existing FavOrg application's QA Audit Log System and then develop a completely new, separate .
**FavOrg Audit Log Enhancements:**
*   **UI/UX:** Compact design, sidebar with category counters, status buttons (green, red, orange, blue with Lucide icons), tooltips, and a meta-testing category.
*   **Functionality:** Add/delete/edit tests and notes, search, archive reports, and critical  persistence for , , and .
*   **Reporting:** Structured PDF reports (all/tested items), specific header layout (QA-Bericht title, version/tester/date).
*   **Core:** Modern loading indicator, tooltip toggle, pagination, redesigned footer.
*   **Bug Fixes:** Resolved double-X button, spacing, tooltip toggle, and blank PDF page 3 issues.
**New QA-Report-App:**
*   **Core:** Separate multi-project (Company → Project → Test Suites), multi-user (Admin, QA-Tester, Reviewer) management system.
*   **Technology:** PostgreSQL (planned, SQLite used for dev), JWT authentication, DE/ENG language toggle.
*   **Features:** Import/export functionality (JSON/CSV) with template generation.
*   **Migration:** The old FavOrg AuditLog is to be removed, replaced by a JSON export for migration into the new system.
The latest user request focused on replacing existing test points with a new GUI-oriented list for the FavOrg AuditLog, adhering to a specific ID structure (e.g., AD0001).

<code_architecture>

The application consists of two main parts: the existing FavOrg application and the newly developed .
- : This file defines the React component for the integrated Audit Log view in the FavOrg application. It was extensively modified to update ,  mapping, , and  to reflect the new GUI-oriented test points and ensure Allgemeines Design appeared in the sidebar.
- : This script initializes the SQLite database for the . It was crucial for loading the new GUI-oriented test points into the database after user requests and modifications.
- : The FastAPI entry point for the . It manages router imports, database configuration, and CORS. Implicitly updated to handle routing for new test points.
-  and : These backend route files manage CRUD operations for test suites and cases. They were adapted to work with the new test points and GUI-oriented categories.
- : Contains environment variables for the QA-Report-App frontend, including . It was temporarily modified to change the frontend port from 3000 to 3001 to avoid conflicts.
- : A new component for handling import/export functionality in the QA-Report-App. It was modified to fix TypeScript compilation errors related to  functions and  typing.
- : A new template file used for migrating FavOrg test points into the QA-Report-App. It was updated with the new GUI-oriented test points.

<pending_tasks>
- **QA-Report-App (Phase 2 - continued):** Finalize multi-language support (DE/ENG) for data content.
- **QA-Report-App (Phase 3 - continued):** Implement Excel format for import/export, complete PDF export system, and archive system.
- **QA-Report-App (Phase 4):** Implement the full migration flow for existing FavOrg AuditLog data and remove the old AuditLog component from FavOrg.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer focused on updating the  and ensuring the  runs correctly with new GUI-oriented test points.
1.  **Test Point Update:** User requested a new GUI-oriented test point list for the FavOrg AuditLog, replacing the old ones with a specific ID structure (e.g., BOM0001: Button Ort: Mittig).
    *   The  was extensively modified to update ,  mapping, , and  to incorporate these new test points.
    *   The  backend's  script was re-run to seed the database with these new test points, replacing the older ones (e.g., AD0001: Corporate Identity prüfen was replaced by GUI-focused items like BOM0001: Button Ort: Mittig).
    *   The  was updated with the new GUI-oriented test cases.
2.  **QA-Report-App Frontend Fixes:**
    *   Resolved an issue where the  frontend (React) attempted to use port 3000, which was already occupied by the FavOrg frontend. This was fixed by explicitly starting the QA-Report-App frontend on port 3001.
    *   Addressed multiple TypeScript compilation errors in , specifically related to the typing of  functions and .
3.  **FavOrg AuditLog Sidebar Correction:** The user reported that Allgemeines Design was missing from the FavOrg AuditLog sidebar. This was promptly corrected by re-adding it to , , and updating the icon mapping in .
The current state is that the FavOrg AuditLog system now displays Allgemeines Design as the first category in the sidebar, populated with the new GUI-oriented test points. The QA-Report-App frontend is now runnable on port 3001, and its backend is confirmed to be running and accessible.
