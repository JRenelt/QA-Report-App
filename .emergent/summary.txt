The AI engineer's work pivoted from refining the existing FavOrg Audit Log System to building a new, standalone QA-Report-App. Initial efforts involved enhancing FavOrg's UI/UX, fixing bugs like the double-X button, and implementing  persistence and detailed PDF exports. The core of the trajectory details the successful completion of the QA-Report-App's foundation (FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL/SQLite, JWT auth, React frontend). Key challenges included resolving Tailwind CSS v4 vs v3 configuration issues, fixing complex SQLAlchemy  errors, and iterating on password hashing for authentication. The project progressed to core functionalities like login, dashboard, project hierarchy, test suite management, and culminated in implementing a robust import/export system, generating comprehensive documentation, and providing all project files to the user.

<product_requirements>
The FavOrg application initially required enhancements to its hidden QA Audit Log System and core bookmark features. Key requests included:
- **Audit Log UI/UX**: Compact design, sidebar with category counters, status buttons (green, red, orange, blue) with Lucide icons and tooltips, meta-testing category.
- **Functionality**: Add/delete/edit tests, notes, search, archive reports, and critical  persistence for , , and .
- **Reporting (PDF)**: Structured QA reports displaying *all* or *only tested* items, specific header layout, QA-Bericht title, version/tester/date layout.
- **FavOrg Core**: Modern loading indicator, tooltip toggle in settings, pagination with tape-recorder Lucide icons, and a redesigned footer with specific left/center/right alignment (copyright, pagination, Impressum).
- **Persistent Bug Fixes**: Multiple iterations to fix a double-X symbol on delete buttons, precise spacing adjustments, ensuring tooltip toggles function correctly, and addressing a PDF page 3 blank issue.
- **New QA-Report-App**: A separate application with a multi-project (Firma → Projekt → Test-Suiten) and multi-user (Admin, QA-Tester, Reviewer) management system, PostgreSQL for data, JWT authentication, DE/ENG language toggle, and import/export functionality (JSON/CSV) with template generation. The old AuditLog in FavOrg is to be removed, replaced by a JSON export for migration.

<pending_tasks>
- **QA-Report-App (Phase 2 - continued):** Finalize multi-language support (DE/ENG) for data content, not just UI.
- **QA-Report-App (Phase 3 - continued):** Implement Excel format for import/export, complete PDF export system, and archive system.
- **QA-Report-App (Phase 4):** Implement the full migration flow for existing FavOrg AuditLog data (beyond just templates), remove the old AuditLog component from FavOrg.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the implementation of PHASE 3: Advanced Features for the new  based on explicit user requests.

This phase focused on:
1.  **CORS Problem Resolution**: The login failure (Anmeldung fehlgeschlagen) due to an  was debugged and the backend's CORS configuration in  was enhanced to ensure successful preflight requests and full login functionality.
2.  **Login Success & Dashboard Display**: Upon successful login ( / ), the dashboard () correctly displayed user information (QA Administrator), system status (all services Connected), and backend version (QA-Report-App v1.0.0).
3.  **Dashboard with Real Data**: The dashboard was populated with seeded data, showing 1 Firmen, 1 Projekte, and 4 Test-Suiten. API endpoints for  and  were refined, and the  component was created to render this hierarchical data with tab navigation and action buttons.
4.  **Test-Suite Management Interface**: A comprehensive  component was developed. Backend routers for  and  were created and integrated into . This enabled:
    *   Display of 4 test suites with a card-based UI.
    *   A modal for managing individual test cases with IDs, priorities, and descriptions.
    *   A Test-Execution-Modus featuring progress tracking, current test details, expected results, result marking buttons, navigation, and a notes field.
5.  **Documentation and Import/Export System**: In response to the user's request, the AI engineer:
    *   Created  for detailed setup on XAMPP/Hostsharing.net.
    *   Developed  and .
    *   Implemented  for backend import/export logic.
    *   Created  for the frontend UI.
    *   Generated template files: ,  (pre-filled with 22 FavOrg test points), and .
    *   The  script was updated to seed the database with these 22 FavOrg test points as initial demo data.
6.  **Project Files Provision**: The final action was to provide the user with a structured overview of all project files (, ) and the generated documentation/templates, as a virtual ZIP delivery since actual ZIP file creation is not possible.
