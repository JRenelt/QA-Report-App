The AI engineer's work centered on refining the FavOrg application's Audit Log System, focusing on UI/UX, PDF export functionality, and fixing several critical bugs. The process involved iterative debugging of JavaScript issues, meticulous CSS adjustments for layout, and dynamic content rendering. Key efforts included implementing a structured PDF report with configurable metadata, enhancing the internal Audit Log view with a sidebar, and ensuring UI consistency (e.g., button styles, spacing). Significant challenges included resolving a persistent application not loading issue caused by JavaScript global variable errors (, , , ) and continually adjusting button states and layouts based on detailed user feedback. The engineer consistently used the testing agent and troubleshoot agent to identify and resolve issues, demonstrating a methodical approach to complex frontend development. The work is currently focused on replacing emoji icons with Lucide icons.

<product_requirements>
The FavOrg application is a bookmark manager with an advanced, hidden Audit Log System for QA. The user requested:
-   **UI/UX**: Compact header, compact test point displays, sticky footer with status filters and counters. Reorganize System-Tools into a 2x2 grid in settings. Internal Audit Log to sidebar layout with 10px spacing from app header/footer, 100% width. Test point cards: Status buttons (green, red, orange, blue) should be background colored, inactive ones pale, active ones distinct. Edit/Note buttons on the right, in outline format.
-   **Functionality**: Add/delete test points, search, add notes, visual status indicators. Archive functionality with view/load/delete reports. Configurable metadata for PDF (Tester, Version, Test Environment, Goal, Methodology). Sidebar category counters that decrease and turn green when 0.
-   **Reporting**: Structured, professional PDF export (FavOrg design, specific layout, page breaks, metadata, test cases, results, issues, conclusion, appendix, system-derived version). Gesamt√ºbersicht on the first page.
-   **Accessibility**: Open Audit Log in new window (), and internal view. Help/Tech.Docu updates and Lucide icon implementation.
-   **Bug Fixes**: Resolve light gray text on white background in . Fix  to  version display (lowercase 'v'). Ensure Config window is scrollable and has 10px margin.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a new set of user requirements. The application had just recovered from critical JavaScript errors ( and global // undefined issues) that prevented the preview from loading, which were successfully resolved. The user then provided feedback on four new areas:
1.  **Test Report Design**: Adjusting background and text colors for Gesamt√ºbersicht and the Bericht drucken button within the PDF report to use  background and  text. This was addressed in  and .
2.  **Sidebar Counter**: Implementing a counter system for categories in the sidebar of the AuditLog, where each category's test count dynamically decreases as tests are tested (implied, not explicitly detailed how tested is tracked in the trajectory) and the button turns green when the count reaches zero. This was implemented in  by adding  and adjusting sidebar rendering.
3.  **Help and Tech.Docu Update**: Updating the application's help and technical documentation () to reflect the newly added features and changes to the AuditLog system. This was successfully completed.
4.  **Lucide Icons**: Checking if existing emoji icons could be replaced with Lucide icons for a more consistent and professional UI, and then implementing the replacement if suitable. The AI engineer confirmed Lucide Icons are installed and had just started replacing important emoji icons with Lucide Icons in  when the trajectory ended.
