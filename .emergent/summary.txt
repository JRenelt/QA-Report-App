The AI engineer has been meticulously working on the QA-Report-App, transitioning it from an MVP to a more robust system. A significant portion of the trajectory focused on resolving dynamic data loading issues, UI inconsistencies, and persistent database operation problems, often complicated by authentication failures and local storage synchronization challenges. The core issue that consumed the latter part of the development cycle was a persistent Mixed Content error, where the frontend (running on HTTPS) attempted to make API calls via HTTP. Despite numerous code fixes (Auth token, hardcoded projects, URL protocols) and attempts to bypass caching mechanisms, the deployed frontend continued to serve outdated JavaScript bundles from a CloudFront CDN. This infrastructure-level caching issue has blocked all recent code changes from becoming visible and functional in the preview environment, leading to user frustration. The engineer has identified the CDN as the root cause and has provided instructions for user to contact support, while simultaneously making the application deployment-ready by removing all hardcoded URLs.

<product_requirements>
The QA-Report-App is a full-stack, German-localized application for QA reporting (FastAPI/MongoDB backend, React/TypeScript frontend). It generates PDF reports, imports/exports Excel/CSV, and supports Admin/QA-Tester roles. Features include:
*   **UI/UX:** Fixed headers/footers, dark mode, multi-tab settings, dynamic sidebar for project selection, square filter buttons, improved login contrast.
*   **Data Management:** Comprehensive Company & Project Management with template download/import and correct ID generation. Dynamic data loading from backend, synchronized with .
*   **Role-based Access:** Restricted Gefahrenbereich, tech docs, mass data generation, and glossary to Admin-only. QA-Testers see only their company, with restricted create/delete.
*   **Database Operations:** Datenbank leeren (clear database, preserving ID2 company/admin users, deleting projects/test data, clearing local storage), DB Optimieren, and mass data generation for performance testing (Admin-only).
*   **Test Data/Templates:** Dynamically load projects and associated test data.
*   **ID Format:** Test IDs derived from initials of test case titles.
*   **Documentation:** Persistent project rules and a glossary/wiki.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Configured to dynamically load its port using .
-   ****: Implemented a check before mass data generation, returning HTTP 409 if projects exist.
-   ****: Manages global  state, reading from .
-   ****:
    -   Removed hardcoded fallback projects and adjusted polling logic.
    -   Added an  hook for initial backend project loading and a manual Reload button in the header.
    -   All hardcoded backend URLs replaced with .
-   ****: Corrected  storage from  to  in .
-   ****:
    -    and  now include  checks, 409 error handling, and instruct manual page reload after success.
    -   PDF/CSV export endpoints corrected, and  extension fixed for Excel export.
    -   Project existence checks added to export functions.
    -   Temporarily implemented a sidebar, but this was reverted due to TypeScript errors and is no longer present in the code. All backend URLs now correctly use .
-   ****: Removed hardcoded fallback projects.
-   ****: Updated with rules on frontend anomalies, browser cache clearing, and user browser preferences.

<pending_tasks>
-   **PDF Report Structure:** Rework the test report preview ().
-   **PDF/CSV Export Dialogs:** Implement Save as dialogs with explicit file naming.
-   **Test Data Load Function:** Implement the Load Test Data function.
-   **Dark/Bright Mode UI Anpassungen:** Address remaining UI elements not adapting correctly.
-   **User/Company Management Enhancements:** Admin needs CRUD for all users/companies, ability to block. QA-Tester needs restricted profile editing.
-   **Glossary Update:** Add Dashboard, Modal, Settings-Modal to the glossary.
-   **CDN Cache Invalidierung:** Critical blocker: CloudFront CDN is serving old JavaScript bundles, causing Mixed Content errors and preventing new fixes from being visible. This requires support intervention.

<current_work>
The AI engineer's current work revolves around a critical deployment and caching issue. Despite numerous code changes, including correcting authentication token storage, removing hardcoded projects, ensuring  is cleared, fixing API endpoints, and replacing all hardcoded backend URLs with environment variables (making the app Deployment-Ready), the deployed frontend preview consistently exhibits Mixed Content errors. This occurs because the CloudFront CDN continues to serve an older JavaScript bundle that still attempts API calls over HTTP instead of HTTPS. Consequently, none of the recent fixes are visible or functional to the user, leading to a Failed to fetch error for most backend operations (mass data generation, test data generation, database operations). The backend itself confirms successful data generation, but the frontend cannot retrieve or display it. The user has contacted support, and the AI engineer has provided detailed testing instructions and follow-up email drafts. The current state is that the code is functionally correct and deployment-ready, but the live preview environment is broken due to an external CDN caching problem, which is outside the AI engineer's direct control to resolve via code. The user's latest input indicates they are still seeing the HTTP error despite following instructions, and support has suggested the AI engineer fix it using DEV-Tool messages.
