The AI engineer's work evolved from extensive iterative refinements of the FavOrg application's integrated and standalone Audit Log System to a complete architectural shift towards building a new, separate QA-Report-App. Initial efforts focused on UI/UX overhauls, Lucide icon integration, detailed PDF export options (including only tested reports), and critical bug fixes like  persistence and a complex, recurring double-X button issue. User feedback was highly granular, involving precise layout, spacing (often requiring multiple interpretations and corrections), and functional details. The latter half of the trajectory details the successful completion of Phase 1 (Foundation) for the new QA-Report-App, which includes a new FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL, JWT authentication, and a basic React frontend structure, leading into Phase 2 (Core Functionality) for frontend setup.

<product_requirements>
The FavOrg application initially required enhancements to its hidden QA Audit Log System and core bookmark features. Key requests included:
- **Audit Log UI/UX**: Compact design, sidebar with category counters, status buttons (green, red, orange, blue) with Lucide icons and tooltips, meta-testing category.
- **Functionality**: Add/delete/edit tests, notes, search, archive reports, and critical  persistence for , , and .
- **Reporting (PDF)**: Structured QA reports displaying *all* or *only tested* items, specific header layout, QA-Bericht title, version/tester/date layout.
- **FavOrg Core**: Modern loading indicator, tooltip toggle in settings, pagination with tape-recorder Lucide icons, and a redesigned footer with specific left/center/right alignment (copyright, pagination, Impressum).
- **Persistent Bug Fixes**: Multiple iterations to fix a double-X symbol on delete buttons, precise spacing adjustments, ensuring tooltip toggles function correctly, and addressing a PDF page 3 blank issue.
- **New QA-Report-App**: A separate application with a multi-project (Firma → Projekt → Test-Suiten) and multi-user (Admin, QA-Tester, Reviewer) management system, PostgreSQL for data, JWT authentication, DE/ENG language toggle, and import/export functionality (JSON/CSV) with template generation. The old AuditLog in FavOrg is to be removed, replaced by a JSON export for migration.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React (components, state, hooks), Vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, , responsive design.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
- **Database**: MongoDB (existing FavOrg), PostgreSQL (new QA-Report-App).
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes container environment, Docker.
- **UI/UX**: Tooltips, Dialogs, Modals, Pagination, Internationalization.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>

- : Central component for FavOrg. Updated with loading indicators, tooltip toggle, pagination logic, and redesigned footer (centered pagination, Impressum link, new copyright text). Navigation can be hidden when AuditLog is active.
- : Standalone Audit Log. Extensive UI/UX updates, Lucide icon migration,  for persistence, PDF export options, and positioning fixes for buttons.
- : React component for integrated Audit Log. Similar UI/UX updates as ,  persistence, PDF export logic (including dynamic IDs), auto-scroll to next test, counter for failed tests, dynamic test editing, and refined button layout/spacing. Critical fixes for persistent double-X delete button issue and tooltip display logic.
- : Help documentation. Updated with new sections on AuditLog features, UI-compactness, and toggle configurations.
- : Technical documentation. Expanded with details on AuditLog system updates, features, and internal changes.
- : New project directory created for the QA-Report-App.
- : Contains FastAPI application files, including  (FastAPI app),  (PostgreSQL connection),  (Pydantic/SQLAlchemy models),  (JWT token handling), and  (API endpoints for auth, users, projects).
- : Defines the PostgreSQL database schema for users, projects, and related entities.
- : Initialized React project structure with , , , .
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **QA-Report-App (Phase 2):** Implement core functionality for project hierarchy (Firma → Projekt → Test-Suiten), project templates, basic test management, and multi-language support (DE/ENG).
- **QA-Report-App (Phase 3):** Implement advanced features like import/export (JSON/CSV), PDF export system, and archive system.
- **QA-Report-App (Phase 4):** Migrate existing FavOrg AuditLog data, remove the old AuditLog component from FavOrg, and finalize documentation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed PHASE 1: FOUNDATION for the new  and started PHASE 2: CORE FUNCTIONALITY.

**PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Completed)**
This involved setting up the basic infrastructure for the new application:
1.  **Project Structure:** Created the  directory and its , , and  subdirectories.
2.  **PostgreSQL Setup:** Defined the database schema in .
3.  **FastAPI Backend Grundstruktur:** Created , , and  files for the backend.  was populated and dependencies installed.
4.  **Authentication System:** Implemented database connection logic (), Pydantic models for data (), and JWT authentication services ().
5.  **Route Strukturen:** Set up API routes for authentication (), user management (), and project management ().

**PHASE 2: CORE FUNCTIONALITY (Started)**
The engineer has just initiated the setup of the React frontend for the new :
1.  **React Frontend Grundgerüst:** Used yarn create v1.22.22
