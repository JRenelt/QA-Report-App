<analysis>
The AI engineer's initial task involved stabilizing the application after a major feature rollout (V2.3.0), fixing backend logic and addressing reported frontend issues stemming from  corruption. After restoring the main application from a test page, the engineer systematically worked through numerous user-reported UI and functional bugs. This included implementing the Meldungen Delay toast, correcting layout shifts, refining several dialogs (Help, Statistics, Settings), fixing status assignment, and restoring the footer. Iterative feedback led to precise adjustments of status filter symbols, dynamic sizing, button functionalities (e.g., Prüfen, Duplikate, Localhost with confirmation prompts), and test data generation. Phase 2 focused on restoring core functionalities like lock/unlock for bookmarks and comprehensive category management, along with drag-and-drop preparations. The process involved deep debugging, systematic file edits, and constant visual verification via screenshots.

<product_requirements>
The FavOrg application is a bookmark manager enabling collection, hierarchical categorization, and detection of duplicates/broken links. Core functionalities include CRUD for bookmarks and categories, drag-and-drop sorting, and write-protection.

User requests and issues addressed or pending in this trajectory are:
1. Meldungen Delay: Toasts with 'X' button should remain visible when setting is true.
2. Category Management: Deleting a category re-assigns bookmarks to Nicht zugeordnet. Ensure subcategory creation works and input fields are dark theme compliant.
3. UI Issues: Correct layout (Sidebar next to MainContent), missing status counts in filters, proper category counts, dark theme compliance for inputs.
4. Footer: Re-implement with copyright, dynamic statistics, and 'Impressum' button.
5. Test Data: Generate 100 diverse datasets, ensure counters are accurate.
6. Button Logic: TOTE Links, Duplikate, Localhost buttons should first find/sort, then prompt for deletion on second click, with correct counters.
7. UI/UX: Refine Statistics dialog (icons, spacing, fonts), Settings icon (gear not wrench), dynamic status filter symbol (Lucide B&W to Funnel-X, dynamic sizing, with/without counts), lock/unlock icons.
8. Pending: Integrate Easter egg, implement Cross-Over Drag & Drop fully, fix lock function visibility, customize TOTE Links and Duplikate button colors.

**<pending_tasks>**
- Remove the Funnel-x symbol from the system, keeping only Funnel at startup and Funnel-x inside the pulldown.
- Integrate the Easter egg triggered by a hidden link in the copyright line.
- Resolve test data generation issue (should generate 100 datasets, visibility of 15 dead links, counter problem).
- Fix the visibility and functionality of the lock/unlock feature for favorites.
- Change TOTE Links button background to light red and Duplikate to orange.
- Implement Phase 3 (UX improvements for drag handles, comprehensive testing).

**<current_work>**
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer had successfully completed Phase 2: Funktionalität and was working on the latest batch of user feedback. The current work involved addressing specific UI and functional refinements:

1.  **Funnel Symbol Consistency**: Ensuring that only the basic Funnel symbol is displayed at the application's start, and the Funnel-X symbol is exclusively used within the filter dropdown for the Alle (All) option. The engineer had just started implementing this.
2.  **Easter Egg Integration**: The user requested integrating an Easter egg, triggered by a hidden link in the copyright line, which is a pending task.
3.  **Test Data Generation Discrepancy**: Investigating why the Testdaten erstellen function, despite backend updates, was still generating only 50 datasets instead of 100, and why a reported 15 dead links were not visible, causing counter discrepancies.
4.  **Lock Function Visibility and Logic**: Addressing the issue where the lock/unlock (Schloss) feature on bookmarks was not visible by default (expected green/open), and the locking action (turning it red/closed) was not functioning as expected.
5.  **Button Color Customization**: Changing the TOTE Links button's background to light red and the Duplikate button's to orange, aligning them with the application's status color coding.

The user also explicitly requested to Perform Phase 3 after these fixes are completed.

**<optional_next_step>**
Continue with the first pending task: 1. Funnel-X Symbol komplett entfernen as stated by the user.
