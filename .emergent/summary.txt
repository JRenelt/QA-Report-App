The AI engineer successfully guided the QA-Report-App from an initial MVP state through multiple iterations, primarily focusing on extensive UI/UX improvements, feature additions, and bug fixes. The work encompassed major UI redesigns, particularly for the dashboard sidebar, implementing dynamic and role-based functionalities, resolving persistent frontend and backend errors (e.g., React hooks, TypeScript type issues, mixed content errors), and refining user interaction elements like tooltips and forms. The development process was highly iterative, driven by continuous user feedback, image analysis, and systematic debugging. Key achievements include a dynamic sidebar, comprehensive company/project management, enhanced login UI, global caching fixes, and intelligent tooltip positioning. The immediate task involves dynamically loading test data based on project selection.

The user requested a QA-Report-App with a FastAPI backend (MongoDB, JWT auth) and React TypeScript frontend, localized in German. Key features include PDF Report Generation, Excel Import/Export, Archive Management, and a multi-user system (Admin, QA-Tester). The core design centered on a detailed  with a fixed header/footer, dark mode, multi-tab settings, and help modals. The dashboard required a left sidebar (Test-Bereiche, later Testfälle) showing dynamic test counts/statuses, a fixed action bar, and interactive test cards.

User feedback continuously focused on UI precision, functional status changes, persistent settings, specific styling for buttons/tooltips, and a compact design. Recent requests included: comprehensive Company & Project Management with admin control; a detailed PDF report structure (pending); explicit versioning; a structured sidebar layout with dynamic counters; role-based restrictions for QA-Testers; improved Login Dark Mode contrast; renaming Testpunkte to Testfälle; template download/import with correct ID generation; auto-opening edit modal for new test cases with auto-focus and default text; dynamic, edge-aware tooltip positioning with a tapering, full-tone line; square filter buttons; and dynamic loading of projects and associated test data.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture:



-   ****: Entry point. Added global NoCache middleware. Modified health check endpoint to .
-   ****: Manages global state. Passes  to  and . Fixed health check API call to .
-   ****: The core dashboard. Restructured sidebar (project selection, counter, test areas). Implemented dynamic tooltip positioning with conical lines. Changed filter buttons to square. Added auto-open edit modal for new test cases with auto-focus/selection and dynamic default description. Implemented polling for  to reflect new projects. Currently being modified to link test suites and test cases to .
-   ****: Improved contrast for elements in Dark Mode.
-   ****: Restricted Gefahrenbereich to admins, limited test data generation for QA-Testers, and implemented PDF/CSV export functionalities.
-   ****: Implemented role-based visibility, hiding Technische Doc and Installationshilfen for QA-Testers.
-   ****: Implemented role-based user filtering and restrictions on create/delete for QA-Testers. Added  to the  interface. Resolved a  role runtime error.
-   ****: Enables admin to select and manage company projects. Implemented correct test ID generation for templates and . Integrated with  for project persistence.
-   ****: Added custom scrollbar styles for Dark Mode.
-   ****: Added global NoCache meta-tags.

<pending_tasks>
-   **PDF Report Structure:** Rework the test report preview () as per detailed user specifications.
-   **PDF/CSV Export Dialogs:** Implement Save as dialogs (explicit file naming) for PDF/CSV exports.
-   **Test Data Load Function:** Implement the Load Test Data function (currently OF).
-   **Dark/Bright Mode UI Anpassungen:** Address remaining UI elements not adapting correctly to dark/light mode.
-   **Hardcoded Test Suites/Cases**: Remove hardcoded test suite/case data and load them dynamically based on .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical UI issue where Testbereiche (test areas) and Testfälle (test cases) in the  were not updating dynamically upon switching projects. The core problem identified was that  and  were hardcoded within the component and lacked any association with a . To resolve this, the AI engineer began implementing a  hook in . This hook is designed to trigger upon changes to the , allowing for dynamic loading and saving of project-specific test data. The last action taken was to add this  hook, and the next step is to remove the old, hardcoded test case data from the component to ensure only dynamically loaded data is used.
