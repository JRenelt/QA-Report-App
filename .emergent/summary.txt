The previous AI engineer’s work progressed iteratively, addressing user feedback in multiple phases. Initially, fixes focused on stabilizing V2.3.0, UI corruption, and core functionalities like toast messages, layout, dialogs, and footer. Key actions included fixing the Funnel symbol in , updating button colors in , correcting test data generation to 100 records in , enabling visible and functional lock/unlock icons, and integrating an Easter egg via the copyright link in . Subsequent feedback led to implementing advanced search with yellow highlighting and hit counts, resolving  errors in category management, refining filter symbol consistency, and redesigning lock buttons. Most recently, the engineer implemented CRUD protection for locked bookmarks, refactored drag-and-drop, introduced a new multi-level live category manager, and began developing a comprehensive help system with PDF export. The work involved deep debugging and iterative testing.

<product_requirements>
The FavOrg application is a bookmark manager designed for collection, hierarchical categorization, duplicate/broken link detection, drag-and-drop sorting, and write-protection.

Key user requirements addressed or pending:
1.  **UI/UX Refinements**: Implement Meldungen Delay toasts, correct layout shifts (Sidebar/MainContent), ensure dark theme compliance, refine dialogs (Help, Statistics, Settings), dynamic status filter symbols (Funnel, Funnel-X), and consistent button styling (TOTE Links, Duplikate, Lock/Unlock). System messages (toasts) should appear in the search bar line.
2.  **Core Functionality**: Comprehensive CRUD for bookmarks and categories, including multi-level subcategories with live editing and visual cues ( signs). Drag-and-drop for sorting bookmarks within and across categories.
3.  **Search & Filtering**: Implement advanced search across titles and descriptions with yellow highlighting for results and a visible hit counter.
4.  **Data Management**: Generate 100 diverse test datasets, ensure accurate status counters, and provide functionalities to find/delete duplicates and localhost links.
5.  **Security/Protection**: Implement a lock/unlock feature for bookmarks, disabling CRUD operations and drag-and-drop for locked items.
6.  **Information & Support**: Integrate an Easter egg, develop a comprehensive help system (wiki-style with PDF export), and update Impressum/technical support emails.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the latest batch of user feedback (Chat Message 288), specifically focusing on Phase 3 enhancements and critical fixes.
The following was achieved:
1.  **Lock-Funktionalität (CRUD & Drag/Drop Protection)**: Implemented logic in  and  to disable edit, delete, and drag-and-drop actions for locked bookmarks. This provides a crucial write-protection feature.
2.  **Drag & Drop Repair**: Re-implemented and refined the  function in  to ensure proper drag-and-drop functionality for bookmark reordering.
3.  **Advanced Category Management**: Created a new  component and integrated it into . This component supports multi-level hierarchical categories with live editing capabilities, addressing the user's request for an expandable category structure.
4.  **Comprehensive Help System**: Created a new  component and integrated it into . This component is intended to provide a wiki-like help interface with PDF export capabilities and updated contact information.

The last successful action was the integration of the  into . The engineer has just started working on the comprehensive help system.
