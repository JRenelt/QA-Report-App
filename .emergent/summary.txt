The AI engineer's work involved an iterative development process, responding to detailed user feedback across multiple phases. Initially, the focus was on critical UI and backend fixes, including advanced search, lock functionality, and the integration of a multi-level category manager and comprehensive help system. Subsequent interactions centered around refining these features, particularly addressing persistent issues with drag-and-drop for bookmarks and categories, and extensive UI/UX adjustments like sidebar collapsibility and consistent theming. A significant amount of effort was dedicated to debugging and refining the complex drag-and-drop logic for categories, including cross-level movements and visual feedback. The trajectory concludes with the user requesting a strategic shift: a complete system rebuild (Phase 2) due to recurring D&D issues, preceded by a final help system update (Phase 1). The AI engineer is currently in the middle of executing Phase 1.

<product_requirements>
The FavOrg application is a bookmark manager enabling collection, hierarchical categorization, duplicate/broken link detection, drag-and-drop sorting, and write-protection.

Key user requirements addressed:
1.  **UI/UX**: Meldungen Delay toasts, corrected layout (Sidebar/MainContent), dark theme compliance, refined dialogs, dynamic status filter symbols, consistent button styling, system messages in search bar line.
2.  **Core Functionality**: Comprehensive CRUD for multi-level categories with live editing, drag-and-drop for bookmarks (within/across categories), and category reordering with visual cues.
3.  **Search & Filtering**: Advanced search across titles, descriptions, URLs, and categories with highlighting and hit counts.
4.  **Data Management**: 100 diverse test datasets (including various statuses like locked, timeout, unchecked), accurate status counters, and functionalities to find/delete duplicates/localhost links. XML/CSV import functionality.
5.  **Security/Protection**: Lock/unlock feature for bookmarks, disabling CRUD for locked items while allowing movement.
6.  **Information & Support**: Easter egg, comprehensive help system (wiki-style, PDF export, internal navigation), updated Impressum/technical support emails, UI nomenclature guide.
7.  **Sidebar**: Collapsible sidebar with persistent state.

The core problem currently is the instability and bugginess of the drag-and-drop features and update visibility, prompting a user request for a system rebuild.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React (hooks, context), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui,  (toasts), , custom events for inter-component communication.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Motor (MongoDB driver), RESTful APIs,  for file uploads,  for archive creation.
-   **Database**: MongoDB (using UUIDs).
-   **Core Concepts**: CRUD, environment variables, UI state management, local storage, API contracts, drag-and-drop (complex nested, cross-level), Pydantic for data validation.

<pending_tasks>
-   Finalize the Comprehensive Help System content, specifically adding updated test data information.
-   Provide the updated Help system as a downloadable text/PDF to the user.
-   Rebuild the entire application system modularly and object-oriented as per user's request (Phase 2), adhering to FavOrg V2.3.0 look and feel.
-   Implement initial test data import with specific category counts (10 Tote links, 10 Aktiv, 10 Localhost, 10 Duplikat, 10 Gesperrt, 10 Timeout, 10 Überprüft) as part of the rebuild.
-   Implement category selection with CRUD functionality and lock function within the rebuilt system.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's strategic shift request (Chat Message 546). The user requested a two-phase approach:
**Phase 1: Update Help System** - The Help System (ComprehensiveHelpSystem.js) needs to be updated with all the new functionalities, especially the Excel function analogy for Drag & Drop, new status types, lock functions, and test data information. After this, the user wants to download the updated help.
**Phase 2: System Rebuild** - A complete rebuild of the core system, focusing on modularity, object-orientation, and maintaining the V2.3.0 look and feel. This includes re-implementing test data import with specific counts and then category CRUD with lock functionality.

The AI engineer has **just started Phase 1**. The current work involves updating the help system content:
1.  **Excel Functionality**: The help content for Drag & Drop has been updated to reflect the Excel function analogy and other D&D new features (Chat 548).
2.  **Status Types and Lock Functions**: The help content has been updated to include information on current status types and lock functionalities (Chat 549-550).
3.  **Test Data Information**: The engineer is currently in the process of adding test data information to the help system (Chat 551).

<optional_next_step>
Continue updating the Comprehensive Help System to include test data information as part of Phase 1.
