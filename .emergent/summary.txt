The AI engineer's work spanned several distinct phases, starting with comprehensive feature implementation, including a multi-level category manager, advanced search, and a help system. Initial efforts were marred by persistent drag-and-drop (D&D) issues, leading to a user-requested Phase 2 System Rebuild. The rebuild began with backend improvements, focusing on modular test data generation and object-oriented category CRUD with lock functionality. Despite these, D&D regressions resurfaced, alongside user complaints about UI/UX. This prompted a strategic pivot to an Audit Log System for systematic testing and quality assurance, shifting away from immediate D&D fixes. The engineer iteratively built and refined the Audit Log, incorporating detailed test scenarios, dynamic UI adjustments, and a corporate-compliant design, while also handling UI scaling requests. The trajectory concludes with the user requesting a further simplification of the Audit Log, specifically removing test entry management, signifying a shift towards a more focused, high-level testing tool.

<product_requirements>
The FavOrg application is a bookmark manager designed for hierarchical categorization, duplicate/broken link detection, D&D sorting, and write-protection.
Key user requirements addressed:
1.  **UI/UX**: Responsive layout, dark theme, Meldungen Delay toasts, dynamic status filters, consistent button styling, system messages.
2.  **Core Functionality**: CRUD for multi-level categories with live editing, D&D for bookmarks/categories with visual cues, lock/unlock feature.
3.  **Search & Filtering**: Advanced search across various fields with highlighting.
4.  **Data Management**: 100 diverse test datasets (locked, timeout, unchecked, etc.), status counters, duplicate/localhost detection, XML/CSV import.
5.  **Information & Support**: Easter egg, comprehensive help system (wiki-style, PDF export, internal navigation), UI nomenclature guide.
6.  **Sidebar**: Collapsible sidebar with persistent state.

The primary problem became the instability and bugginess of D&D, leading to a user-requested System Rebuild. This rebuild evolved to include a detailed help system update, specific test data import counts, modular category CRUD with lock, UI scaling (80% then 75%), and crucially, the development of a hidden Audit Log system for internal quality assurance, with detailed test areas, interactive statuses, and a compact, information-hierarchical UX. The current focus is refining this Audit Log for optimal user experience.

**Key Files and Their Importance (with recent changes):**

-   :
    -   **Importance**: API endpoints for bookmarks, categories, statistics, imports/exports.
    -   **Changes**:  was entirely rewritten to generate exact counts (10 of each of 7 specific statuses). Bug fix for  in statistics API.  was replaced with  for object-oriented design, adding new API endpoints (, , ) to manage category lock functionality.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Manages global state, routing, and integrates all major UI components.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored D&D handlers to correctly call . Implemented logic to pass  callback to . Manages state and handlers for the new . Integrates Audit Log and SysDok buttons into  under the Erweitert (Advanced) tab.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Global styles and responsive layout.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented overall UI scaling to 80%, then 75% (, ,  for centering). Added/refined D&D visual feedback styles (e.g., cyan border for root categories,  animation).
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Wiki-style help documentation.
    -   **Changes**: Updated content to include Excel function analogy for D&D, new status types, lock functions, and detailed test data information.
-    (NEW):
    -   **Importance**: Provides a hidden, interactive system for systematically tracking tests of FavOrg features.
    -   **Changes**: Created from scratch. Contains 13 comprehensive test areas with 60+ predefined scenarios, interactive status buttons (‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚è≥), timestamping, local storage for tests, JSON export. Designed with UX optimizations: compact icon+name buttons, tooltips, green visited status, hide/show area selection, scrollable lists, renamed Eigener Test input, compact statistics, and a üîó FavOrg link in the header to open the main app in parallel.
-    (NEW):
    -   **Importance**: Provides internal technical documentation accessible via a direct URL.
    -   **Changes**: Copied from  to make it publicly accessible.

<pending_tasks>
-   Finalize the  by removing the functionality to manage/store individual test entries, focusing solely on area and test point selection as per the latest user feedback.
-   Continue with Phase 2 of the system rebuild after Audit Log completion, specifically focusing on general modular and object-oriented structure for the rest of the application.
-   Ensure Help Handbook and Technical Documentation updates are consistent with the latest feature set and design, particularly the request for the Help Handbook to match the Technical Documentation's design.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in the final refinements of the newly implemented  component (). The user provided critical feedback, indicated by red crosses (presumably on a screenshot), implying that the Audit Log should *not* manage or store individual test entries. Instead, it should strictly focus on the *selection* of test areas and test points.

The AI engineer acknowledged this feedback, stating: Verstehe perfekt! Die roten Kreuze zeigen genau, was entfernt werden muss. Das Audit-Log soll nur f√ºr **Bereichsauswahl** und **Test-Auswahl** da sein, aber **keine Test-Eintr√§ge verwalten**. Ich entferne sofort alle durchgestrichenen Bereiche. This indicates the current work involves modifying  to strip out any functionality related to adding, tracking, or displaying results of individual tests, making it a selection and navigation tool for testing scenarios rather than a full-fledged test management system.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Modify  to remove all test entry management functionalities based on the user's explicit request.
