The AI engineer has transformed a QA-Report-App from a GitHub repository into a full-stack application. Initially, the work focused on a complex dashboard () redesign based on user images, involving database migration (SQLAlchemy to MongoDB), JWT authentication, and extensive UI/UX features like dark mode, modals, and dynamic test updates. A major challenge involved resolving persistent frontend compilation issues, specifically a 'return outside function' error in  and  usage, both successfully debugged.

The project then moved into a phase of addressing detailed bug lists and implementing significant new features: dynamic UI elements (tooltips, icons), persistent settings, robust backend integration for test creation and data generation (resolving mixed content errors), and comprehensive documentation. Recent efforts have centered on refining the UI for compactness, implementing company/project management, adding a versioning system, and introducing a detailed footer. The immediate task is to restructure the sidebar to align with a specific user-provided design, after a misinterpretation. The AI demonstrates an iterative development approach, frequently seeking user feedback and correcting course based on precise instructions and visual analysis.

The user requested a QA-Report-App with a FastAPI backend (MongoDB, JWT auth) and React TypeScript frontend, localized in German. Key features include PDF Report Generation, Excel Import/Export, Archive Management, and a multi-user system (Admin, QA-Tester). The core design centered on a detailed  with a fixed header/footer, dark mode, multi-tab settings (Display, Import/Export, Advanced with test data/reset/empty DB), and help modals. The dashboard required a left sidebar with Test-Bereiche showing dynamic test counts/statuses, a fixed action bar, and interactive test cards. User feedback continuously focused on UI precision, functional status changes, persistent settings, specific styling for buttons/tooltips, and a compact design. Recent requests include comprehensive Company & Project Management, a detailed PDF report structure, explicit versioning, and a more structured sidebar layout.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (pymongo), JWT Authentication (python-jose, bcrypt).
- **Frontend**: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide-React for icons, React Router DOM, Local Storage for state persistence.
- **Deployment**: Supervisor, Kubernetes Ingress.
- **Data Handling**: JSON/CSV import/export, UUIDs for MongoDB IDs.
- **Architecture**: Full-stack, client-server model.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture:



-   ****: Entry point, orchestrates FastAPI routers, CORS.
-   ****, ****: Newly added for company and project management APIs.
-   ****: Manages global state (auth, dark mode), routing, now passes  prop.
-   ****: The core component. Extensive modifications for UI (header, sidebar, test cards, fixed footer), logic (test creation, status updates, tooltips), company/project selection, and version display. Critical bug fixes included 'return outside function' and correct  usage.
-   ****: Enhanced with  prop,  fix, and improved error handling for data management.
-   ****: New component for project-specific configuration.
-   ****: New component for CRUD operations on companies and projects, including import functionality and admin protection.
-   ****: Handles API calls to backend, updated to match new backend interfaces (e.g., ).
-   ****: Modified for responsive scaling and compact design.
-   ** & **: Transformed into Wikipedia-style documents, updated with versioning and feature descriptions.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Correct Sidebar Structure:** Restructure the sidebar to match the desired Bild 2 layout (Project Selection as main title, dropdown, General Design as category, test areas as sub-items).
-   **PDF Report Structure:** Rework the test report preview () as per detailed user specifications.
-   **PDF/CSV Export Dialogs:** Implement Save as dialogs for PDF/CSV exports in Settings.
-   **Dark Mode Issues:** Address remaining UI elements not adapting correctly to light mode.
-   **User Management Rework:** Overhaul user management within Company Management, including default QA-Tester creation and optional 2FA.
-   **Backend API Debugging:** Investigate Failed to fetch errors during test creation and the HTTP 404 for test data generation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's feedback regarding the UI design. The user indicated that the previously implemented compact design (Chat Message 517) did not match their target Soll-Bild (Bild 2 from Chat Message 498). The AI engineer re-analyzed Bild 2 (Chat Message 521-522) and identified that the desired sidebar structure was significantly different from the current implementation.

The AI acknowledged the misinterpretation and received explicit instructions to correct the sidebar structure according to Bild 2, ensuring the counter tooltip is also configured (Chat Message 523).

The last action taken (Chat Message 524-525) was to initiate the restructuring of the sidebar in  to align with the Soll-Bild, which involves re-organizing the Project-Auswahl as a main sidebar title, positioning the project dropdown, and defining Allgemeines Design as a main category with test areas as sub-items. This is a significant structural change to the core dashboard UI. The work on setting up the test areas list with 0 badges and tooltips (Chat Message 526) is currently underway.

<optional_next_step>
Continue restructuring the sidebar in  to display test areas as sub-items with 0 badges and tooltips, based on Soll-Bild 2.
