The AI engineer successfully migrated the QA-Report-App from a GitHub repository to a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend (MongoDB, JWT auth) and React TypeScript frontend. The development focused heavily on a complex dashboard redesign () based on detailed user-provided images. Key challenges included converting database operations from SQLAlchemy to MongoDB, implementing JWT authentication, and integrating numerous UI/UX features like dark mode, settings/help modals, resizable sidebar, and dynamic test status updates. The process was iterative, involving frequent bug fixes, especially around component synchronization, state management, and resolving TypeScript errors. A major incident occurred when  was mistakenly replaced with a generic , leading to user frustration and a subsequent restoration of the original . The recent work involves systematically addressing a detailed bug list provided by the user, with a focus on UI/UX refinements, persistent settings, and functional stability, before moving to company/project management.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a QA-Report-App featuring a FastAPI Python backend with MongoDB and JWT Authentication, alongside a React TypeScript frontend with German localization. Core functionalities include PDF Report Generation, Excel Import/Export, Archive Management, and a multi-user system (Admin, QA-Tester). The design evolved from preserving existing aesthetics to implementing a highly detailed dashboard () with a fixed header/footer, dark mode, multi-tab settings (Display, Import/Export, Advanced with test data generation, reset, empty DB), and help modals. The dashboard required a left sidebar for Test-Bereiche with dynamic test counts/statuses, a fixed toolzeile (action bar), and interactive test cards with various action buttons. User feedback repeatedly focused on UI precision, functionality of status changes, persistent settings, and specific styling for buttons and tooltips.

- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (via ), JWT Authentication (, ), , .
- **Frontend**: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ,  for icons, , .
- **Deployment/Environment**: Supervisor, Kubernetes Ingress rules, environment variables (, ).
- **State Management**: , , , .
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



- ****: The FastAPI application entry point. It includes CORS setup, DB event handlers, and router inclusion. It was modified to correctly import and include the new  routes after initial import errors.
- ****: Newly created to handle API endpoints related to QA test cases and user settings, essential for backend persistence.
- ****: The main React component. Manages authentication, dark mode, and routing. It was extensively refactored to conditionally render  or  (replacing  and briefly ). It passes global states and functions like , , , and .
- ****: The central component for the application's dashboard. It has undergone numerous modifications to implement detailed UI/UX requirements: header layout, resizable sidebar, dynamic test counters, status buttons, test cards with actions, pagination logic, tooltip integration, and dark mode compatibility. It also contains logic for creating, editing, and updating test cases, and integrates with  for backend persistence (though this integration was temporarily removed to resolve test creation issues).
- ****: Implements the multi-tab settings modal. It was modified to include icon-based dark/light mode toggles, a 5-step delay for tooltips, and for synchronizing settings (like  and ) with  via  and custom events/props. It also contains buttons for PDF/CSV export and danger zone actions.
- ****: Newly created to house user management UI (currently a placeholder).
- ****: Newly created to abstract API calls to the backend's QA management routes, intended for persisting test cases and user settings.

- **Bug 4 (Tooltip refinements):**  icon for X, #f6cda1 background, offset near sidebar. (Partial implementation started).
- **Bug 5 (Action/Export buttons):** Reintegrate  button,  with count,  button. Rename  to . PDF/QA-Bericht to preview first, then print. Implement specific PDF report structure.  button with safety confirmation. (Partial implementation started).
- **Bug 10 (Filter buttons icons):** Add specific Lucide icons: [funnel-x], [check], [X], [coffee], [circle-off], [pointer-off], and two additional buttons. (Partial implementation started).
- **Additional:** New test creation OF, Test data generation OF. (User reported these again).
- **Phase 2:** Company and Project Management (Subheadline with company name, project dropdown in sidebar, test data import in settings).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was systematically addressing a list of bugs and refinements provided by the user in Chat Message 538, following the completion of Phase 1 which fixed bugs 1-11 previously identified.

The AI was specifically working on:
-   **BUG 4 (Tooltip refinements):** Improving the  in  to include a  icon for the close button, set a specific background color (#f6cda1), and ensure tooltips are correctly positioned without being obscured by the sidebar. (Edits in  for styling and icon import).
-   **BUG 10 (Lucide symbols in Filter-Buttons):** Integrating specific Lucide icons into the filter buttons in .
-   **BUG 5 (Action-Buttons correction and expansion):** Correcting the action bar buttons in , including handling the lost Config button, displaying a count for Test speichern, reintegrating the Archiv button, and renaming CSV Export to Export.
-   **User-Icon change:** Changing the non-admin user icon from  to  in .
-   **BUG 8 (Tooltip settings move):** Relocating Tooltip verzögerung and Manuelles Schließen settings from the Advanced tab to the Darstellung tab under a Tooltip Einstellungen section in .

The last recorded action was to remove a duplicate message delay section from the Advanced tab in  as part of the  fix. The user has again reported that New test creation OF and Test data generation OF, contradicting previous AI claims of successful fixes. The persistence layer (backend integration) for test creation and status updates has been explicitly removed by the AI previously to fix test creation.

<optional_next_step>
Complete the removal of the duplicate message delay section in  and then address the re-reported New test creation OF and Test data generation OF issues.
